# Security Policy

If you find any vulnerabilities in PokÃ©Log, please don't open an issue as these
are publicly accessible. Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
by navigating to `Security -> Advisories` and clicking the `Report a
vulnerability` button:

![Report
Button](https://github.com/vinnydiehl/pokelog/blob/trunk/.github/images/report_vulnerability.png?raw=true)

This method is preferred, however you may also contact the developer privately
via [email](mailto:dev.pokelog@gmail.com).
