# Generations Specs

With no generation selected, Pok√©mon from all generations are shown in the
search results, and the behavior of everything else is set to the most recent
generation by default. This core behavior tested throughout the rest of the
test suite. These specs only for cases where the generation has been changed.

These tests have been spread out to multiple files to allow them to be better
parallelized in CI.
